* try_wait() for sync objects, or maybe only for mutexes
  (may be included in the minor release if affects only
  fully-inlined objects, e.g. mutex)

* linux binary rpm package

* make seek() methods truly polymorphic (currently broken in memory
  streams) in the next major release (?)

* there is a problem with reusability of fdxstm objects (and
  derivatives, g.e. ipstream): the active status of input and output
  streams is not always in sync

* make pnull a full duplex stream (?)

* wshare: use jobqueue and a thread pool for better performance. not
  sure yet what to do with crashed threads, or even how to detect that
  one of the threads crashed (?)

* wshare as a WinNT service (?)

* describe alength(), aput(), aget() and akey() in the documentation, or
  at least only alength() and aget()

* add case-insensitive versions of contains() functions (maybe in the
  pstringx add-on?)

* unicode dynamic strings, wstring class (?)
  
* add-on: SSL filter streams

* add-on: zlib filter streams

* wshare: support virtual hosts and possibly some configuration options
  in '.htconf'; (this may be a separate branch of wshare, to keep the
  library demo simple) (?)
