PTypes Development Branch
-------------------------


NOTE: THE SOURCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT VERSION DO NOT CONTAIN COPYRIGHT
      NOTICES AND CAN NOT BE DISTRIBUTED IN THIS FORM. USE THE APPROPRIATE
      SHELL SCRIPT TO BUILD THE DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE.


The development version of the library contains extra files which are not 
included in the distribution:

    mkdistr (Unix shell script): builds the distribution package: adds
        standard header comments to all C++ source files and Makefile's,
        converts the header files to HTML using webcpp and finally
        creates the disrtibution tarball. The release number is taken
        from VERSION.

    mkdocref (Unix shell script): builds the alphabetical reference file
        for the documentation; called from mkdistr
    
    mkhtsrc (Unix shell script): builds the library header files in HTML
        format; called from mkdistr

    doc/ref.tmpl.html: template for the reference file generated by
        mkdocref

    AuxFiles/CXX-HEADER: standard header with copyright notice and version 
        info for C++ source files.

    AuxFiles/SH-HEADER: standard header with copyright notice and version 
        info for shell scripts and Makefile's.

    AuxFiles/*.psd: Photoshop image files for the images used in the 
        documentation.
